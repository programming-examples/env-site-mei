			<h2> Here are somethings we have done to help make our community a cleaner place:</h2>
			
			
			<p>
				<ol><li> We have cleaned up the nearby beaches </li>
						This is done by our amazing volunteers. Every Saturday they start at 7am in the morning and pick up any rubbish on the nearby beaches. 
					<br><br>
					<li> Educate the local community on the importance of recycling </li>
						Our hardworking volunteers have educated the community on why they think recycling is important. They have visited the local schools as we believe if we want to change society we have to start with the young people. They also visit local businesses and help them realise how they can make their business more environmentally friendly. 
					<br><br>
					<li> Organising fun competitions </li>
						Our team has organised numerous competitions throughout the years. These have included who can pick up the most rubbish on the street, who can have the least waste in a week and many more. We are currently holding a competition on who can come up a new idea on how we can become more environmentally friendly.
